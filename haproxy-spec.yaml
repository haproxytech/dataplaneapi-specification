      Sites array. Sites are considered as one service and all farms connected to that service.
      Farms are connected to service using use-backend and default_backend directives. Sites let you
      configure simple HAProxy configurations, for more advanced options use /haproxy/configuration
      endpoints.

      Managing transactions. Configuration changes can be grouped in the transaction. You start the
      transaction with trasactions POST, and call the configuration changes you need with parameter
      transaction_id. When you want to commit the transaction, you call the transactions PUT and all changes
      in that transaction is commited. If you call a configuration change without the transaction_id,
      transaction mechanism is implicitly called with one operation in transaction.
  - name: Reloads
    description: |
      Checking reload success. To avoid constant reloading we reload in intervals that are configurable when
      with reload-delay option. When a change to configuration is made and force_reload url query string
      parameter is false we issue a request for reload, and return the reload ID in response header. You can
      then use reloads endpoints to check the status of that reload ID. If force_reload is true, we override all
      of this and reload immediately.
